**	@{
**
**	The node router is a way to dispatch inbound packets to a specific
**	packet handler based on a hierarchical interpretation of the path
**	options. When an inbound packet is being processed, it starts out
**	being evaluated at the root node. If the next path option of the
**	inbound packet matches the name of one of the children of the current
**	node, we descent into that child and move forward to the next path
**	element. We continue to descend and follow this process until we get
**	to a node where we don't have a match. Once this happens—even if
**	there are additional path elements which haven't matched—the packet
**	is processed by the handler of the current node.
**
**	Keep in mind that this parsing of the path and descending into child
**	nodes happens if there is a handler specified for that node or not.
**
**	If a handler isn't specified, the list handler is used. The list
**	handler is simply a convenience function which returns a link list of
**	that node's children. It's handy and easy to use, but in exchange you
**	give up a little flexibility. For example, with the exception of
**	adding child nodes, you currently can't programmatically add entries
**	to the list, nor can you easily add additional attributes to items in
**	the list.
**
**	As a convenience (that, by the way, is actually built into the list
**	node), if the root doesn't have a handler (and neither does
**	"/.well-known/core"), then a request for "/.well-known/core" is
**	interpreted as a request for the root (but will yield absolute URIs in
**	the link list instead of relative URIs). But this is really only
**	useful for quick prototyping: to do proper service discovery, you'll
**	need to list more than just the contents of your root node: so unless
**	you are doing something very simple, you will likely need a custom
**	handler for "/.well-known" or "/.well-known/core".
**
**	If your device is really constrained, you may want to consider not
**	using the node router, writing your own request router instead. You
**	would have an inbound packet handler that would simply examine the
**	path options and optionally call other handlers directly depending on
**	whatever criteria you want. You don't get the convenience of the
**	"list" handler, but you do get something that is much smaller and
**	flexible.
**
**	The convention of the node router (which is also followed by the
**	"variable node") is that when your handler is called that the next
**	option you fetch will be the option immediately after the path that
**	was evaluated to get you to that handler. So if you want to use the
**	variable node handler to wrap around getting and setting variables
**	("a", "b", and "c") that lives at "/mydevice/blah/", when the variable
**	node handles a GET for "/mydevice/blah/a", the first option it fetches
**	will be the urlpath option "a".
