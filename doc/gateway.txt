# X10

raw x10 commands are encoded using the following ascii shorthand:

	* '*' - Start marker
	* '0' - Zero bit
	* '1' - One bit
	* ' ' - Ignored (all whitespace)
	* '.' - Pause for three cycles (End of packet)
	* 'HA', 'HB', etc.. - House Code Shorthand, 4 bits.
	* 'D1', 'D2', ..., 'D16' - Device code shorthand, 5 bits.
	* '0xHH' - output hex value HH as eight bits.

Observing '/x' will allow you to sniff x10 traffic. When observing traffic,
there are a few other symbols:

	* '!' - Bad bit. Happens when you have a signal on two zero-crossings,
		and when you have less than 6 consecutive zero-crossings without
		a signal (more than six will give you a '.'). Bad bits are not
		reported unless we are currently reading a packet.

- /x10
	- /x				send/receive raw x10 commands
	- /[house] (a ... p)
		- /lights		(0 / 1)
		- /all			(0 only)
		- /[device]		(1...16)
			- /st		(0 / 1)
			- /amt		(0 ... 22)
			- /amt?adj	(-22 ... 22)
			- /hail

ex:
	* /x10/a/9/st
	* /x10/c/3/amt?adj
	* /x10/x?c=*HAD4.*HAD4.*HA00101.*HA00101.	"Turn on A4"

# 1-Wire

[cmd-seq] describes bits to be sent on the wire and when to
listen for responses. For exmple, to read the temperature
from a temperature sensor, you would GET the following:

	/ow/28/000000000000/x?c=bexxxx;f=s

This will sent command '0xBE' to the sensor and fetch
the next two bytes, indicating that the bytes represent
a (S)igned integer. To set the high
temperature alarm, you need to skip the first two bytes.
Yu can do that by sending empty read slots---zeros---for
the first two bytes. You can also use this mechanism for
setting values via PUT. for example, to set the high-temp
alarm value, you would PUT the value to the following path:

	/ow/28/000000000000/x?c=4e0000xx;f=s

Possible values for 'f' are:

	* s - signedinteger
	* u - unsigned integer
	* r - raw binary data
	* t - raw ASCII/UTF8 data

- /ow
	- /x?c=[cmd-seq];f=[fmt]
	- /alarm			Same as "/all", but only alarmed devices.
	- /all
		- /[family-code]	(01 ... FF)
			-/[serial]
				-/x?c=[cmd-seq];f=[fmt]

Some device families may have additional variables for convenience:

	* "28" (temperature sensor)
		- /t			temp
		- /ah			alarm-high
		- /al			alarm-low
		- /res			temperature resolution
		- /c			post to commit
