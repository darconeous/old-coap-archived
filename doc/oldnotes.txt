Various thoughts and notes about the SMCP protocol. Given here largely for
historical and educational purposes. This document may not reflect the current
state of the protocol. - Robert Quattlebaum <darco@deepdarc.com>

- Thoughts
    - Each device has a hierarchy of nodes which can be a directory/subdevice,
      variable, action, or event
    - Events can be paired with Actions so that when an event fires an
      action is induced.
    - Variables can fire events when they change.
    - Variables have actions which allow their value to be changed remotely.
    - Variables can be polled using GET.
    - Devices can be polled for the variables, events, and actions
      associated with it.
    - When a device sends an event to another device (a "change"), the
      circumstances what triggered it is important. Each change message
      contains the address and variable that originated the cascade. When
      the change is processed by a device which may create other change
      messages as a result of an incoming change message, this origin is
      preserved in the resultant messages and the "hop count"  is
      decremented. This way erroneous circular relationships do not flood
      the network with traffic indefinitely.

- Pairing
    - Lets say you wanted to pair a motion sensor to a light.
        - You would have two devices and one pseudo-device:
            - Appliance Module
            - Motion Sensor
            - Timer
        * The motion sensor's motion even would be connected to the
          following:
        * The timer's "fire" event would be connected to the following:
        - Now, whenever the motion sensor is triggered, the light is
          turned on and the timer is reset... When the timer expires
          the timer will fire and the light will turn off.
    - Lets say that there was also a switch. We want to be able to use
      the switch to turn the light on and off, but we don't want the
      timer to time it out. We only want the timer to be enabled
      whenever the motion sensor turns on the light when it wasn't on
      already:
        - We would have three devices and two pseudo-devices:
            - Appliance Module
            - Switch Module
            - Motion Sensor
            - Timer
            - Event Filter
        - Motion Sensor Motion Event connected to...
            - Event Filter Input
        - Event Filter Output is connected to...
            - Appliance Module "Turn On"
            - Timer "Reset"
        - Switch "Turn On" event connected to...
            - Appliance Module "Turn On"
            - Timer "Stop"
        - Switch "Turn Off" event connected to...
            - Appliance Module "Turn Off"
            - Timer "Stop"
        - Switch "State" variable connected to...
            - Event Filter "Pass-Thru-Disable".
