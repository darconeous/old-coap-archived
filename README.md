SMCP — A Full-Featured Embedded CoAP Stack
=========================================

SMCP is a highly-configurable CoAP stack which is suitable for a wide
range of embedded devices, from bare-metal sensor nodes with kilobytes of RAM
to Linux-based devices with megabytes of RAM.

Features include:

 * Supports [RFC7252][1]
 * Fully asynchronous I/O
 * Supports both BSD sockets and [µIP][2]
 * Sending and receiving asynchronous CoAP responses
 * Observing resources and offering observable resources
 * Retransmission of confirmable transactions
 * Multicast groups (Working toward full [RFC7390][3]
   support)
 * Resource pairing
 * [Experimental support for DTLS](https://github.com/darconeous/smcp/issues/35)

The package also includes `smcpctl`, a powerful command line tool for browsing
and configuring CoAP nodes.

SMCP is currently working toward a v1.0 API. Until v1.0 is released, all APIs
are subject to change.

## Getting, building, and installing via Git ##

First:

	$ git clone git://github.com/darconeous/smcp.git
	$ cd smcp

To just build the latest tagged stable release:

	$ git checkout latest-release
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

For bleeding-edge:

	$ git checkout master
	$ git archive origin/autoconf/master | tar xv
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

## Getting, building, and installing from an archive ##

	$ curl https://github.com/darconeous/smcp/archive/full/latest-release.zip > latest-release.zip
	$ unzip latest-release.zip
	$ cd smcp-latest-release
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install	

## Installing via Homebrew on OS X ##

To get the "latest-release":

	$ brew tap darconeous/embedded
	$ brew install smcp

To get the bleeding-edge release:

	$ brew tap darconeous/embedded
	$ brew install smcp --HEAD

Node: This is mostly for people who just want to use `smcpctl` (described below).
If you want to compile against SMCP, you'll currently need to grab the sources
and build against them directly.

## Getting Started ##

The best way to get started is to have a look at some example code
which uses SMCP. There are several included examples:

* `examples/example-1.c` - Shows how to respond to a request.
* `examples/example-2.c` - Shows how to respond to a request for a specific resource.
* `examples/example-3.c` - Shows how to use the node router.
* `examples/example-4.c` - Shows how to make resources observable.

Additionally, there is the plugtest server and client, which can be found
in `src/plugtest`.

The Contiki version of the plugtest uses the last two files. You can find
the Contiki version at `contiki-src/examples/smcp-plugtest/`.

## Configurability ##

One of the goals of SMCP is to implent a full-featured CoAP library, but
most embedded applications don't need all of these capabilities. Because of this,
SMCP is designed so that you can individually enable or disable features
depending on your needs (See `src/smcp/smcp-config.h`).

For example, SMCP has the ability to have more than once instance, but embedded
platforms will never need more than one. Passing around a reference to a
global variable that will never change is wasteful, so when compiled with
`SMCP_EMBEDDED` turned on, we transparently (via some preprocessor magic) ignore
the reference to the SMCP instance from all of the functions that take it.
This makes it easy to use the same codebase for both embedded and non-embedded
applications. There are other configuration options for doing things like
limiting `malloc()` usage, avoiding use of `printf()` (and variants),
enabling/disabling observing, etc.

## Contiki Support ##

SMCP fully supports [Contiki](http://contiki-os.org/). To build the Contiki
examples, just make sure that the `CONTIKI` environment variable is set point
to your Contiki root, like so:

	$ cd contiki-src/examples/smcp-simple
	$ make CONTIKI=~/Projects/contiki TARGET=minimal-net

## API Documentation ##

## `smcpctl` ##

`smcpctl` is a command-line interface for browsing, observing, and
interacting with CoAP devices. It is, for the most part, self-documenting:
just type in `smcpctl help`. You can run individual commands directly from
the command line when invoking `smcpctl` or you can invoke with no
arguments and you will enter the smcpctl shell (CLI). The shell environment
allows you to use familiar unix commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `cat`. The
CLI supports quoting and tab-completion of resource names, which is
incredibly handy.

Here are a few examples of how you can use it:

### GET a resource ###

	$ smcpctl get coap://coap.me/large

### Listing the contents of a resource ###

	$ smcpctl ls coap://coap.me/.well-known/core

### PUT a resource and show parsed response headers ###

	$ smcpctl put -i coap://coap.me/test "Testing out smcpctl's PUT command"

### Observe a resource for changes ###

	$ smcpctl observe coap://vs0.inf.ethz.ch/obs

## `smcpd` ##

`smcpd` is a CoAP daemon that is eventually intended to be a flexible CoAP
server for Linux and other unix-like machines. It is a work in progress.

## Plugtests ##

`smcp-plugtest-server` implements some of the ESTI plugtests for CoAP.
